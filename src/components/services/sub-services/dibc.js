          A boiler is a closed vessel in which fluid (generally water) is
          heated. The fluid does not necessarily boil. The heated or vaporized
          fluid exits the boiler for use in various processes or heating
          applications,[1][2] including water heating, central heating,
          boiler-based power generation, cooking, and sanitation.

          Historically, boilers were a source of many serious injuries and
          property destruction due to poorly understood engineering principles.
          Thin and brittle metal shells can rupture, while poorly welded or
          riveted seams could open up, leading to a violent eruption of the
          pressurized steam. When water is converted to steam it expands to over
          1,000 times its original volume and travels down steam pipes at over
          100 kilometres per hour (62 mph). Because of this, steam is a great
          way of moving energy and heat around a site from a central boiler
          house to where it is needed, but without the right boiler feed water
          treatment, a steam-raising plant will suffer from scale formation and
          corrosion. At best, this increases energy costs and can lead to poor
          quality steam, reduced efficiency, shorter plant life and unreliable
          operation. At worst, it can lead to catastrophic failure and loss of
          life. Collapsed or dislodged boiler tubes can also spray scalding-hot
          steam and smoke out of the air intake and firing chute, injuring the
          firemen who load the coal into the fire chamber. Extremely large
          boilers providing hundreds of horsepower to operate factories can
          potentially demolish entire buildings.[9]

          Boiler Descaling is a very good way to avoid this. This descaling
          treatment protects against corrosion, ensures a continuous heat
          exchange and produces high-quality steam. In turn, it can also help
          the machinery run more efficiently while optimizing costs. Regular
          descaling treatments also work to extend the life of the boiler and
          avoid thermal damage issues.
